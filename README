Simplemarket (A ManaMarket simplified approach for local shops)

This is a simple bot based on ManaMarket code <https://github.com/themanaworld/manamarket>
All you have to do to run it is copying config.py.template to config.py and set its variables:

- server: the server you want to connect. Might work in any tmwAthena/Evol/manaserv based server
- port: the port specified to login server
- account: shop's user account
- password: account's password
- name: shop character name
- character: slot in which character is (first slot is 0)

Then run start.sh and you should be fine.

Features

* Automatic trade accept/decline which is not supported on ManaPlus by default
* Allow you to receive and answer any whispers sent by customers through the console

As simple as that.
